# BlackJackProject

## Description

	The BlackJack project was created to simulate a real life game of BlackJack but without bidding involved. It follows the rule of 17 and other traditional BlackJack rules to keep the game as realistic as possible.

## Technologies Used

-MacBook
-Eclipse
-OOP
-Nested While loops
-Human sounding board for ideas


## Lessons Learned 

	The BlackJack project taught me how to create class structures that make sense. The app should not know what a hand is, that is up to the dealer and player. The hand class should be built in such a way that I can reuse the class for any game with a hand of cards. I also learned how to give aces conditional value based on current state of the game. Also, how to automate a dealer to function as a real dealer would.
